 * Batch Frame Rate Setter for Selected Compositions
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * Description:
 * A simple After Effects script that allows users to batch change the 
 * frame rate of multiple selected compositions at once.
 *
 * How it works:
 * - Filters the current project selection to only include compositions.
 * - Prompts the user to enter a new frame rate.
 * - Updates the frame rate for all selected compositions.
 * - Displays a confirmation alert when complete.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - If no compositions are selected, the script alerts the user.
 * - New frame rate is applied uniformly to all selected comps.
